    <string name="help_text">This game is a mixture of FreeCell and normal (Klondike) Solitaire.\n\nSimilarities to FreeCell:\n   -The Cards in the columns are always visible\n   -There are four individual cells at the top\n\nSimilarities to Solitaire:\n   -There is a deck and discard pile to draw cards from\n   -Only Kings may be placed at the top of an empty column\n   -Cards may be removed from the Ace piles and placed back onto the playing field\n   -Any number of cards can be moved in one move (as long as they are stacked as in Solitaire\n\nFeatures unique to this game:\n   -The four individual cells start with cards in them\n   -You may only go through the deck twice on draw one and three times on draw three\n   -The obvious: there are only four columns, not 7 or 8 as in Solitaire and FreeCell, respectively</string>
