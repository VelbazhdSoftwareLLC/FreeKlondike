Similarities to FreeCell:

   - The Cards in the columns are always visible
   - There are four individual cells at the top

Similarities to Solitaire:

   - There is a deck and discard pile to draw cards from
   - Only Kings may be placed at the top of an empty column
   - Cards may be removed from the Ace piles and placed back onto the playing field
   - Any number of cards can be moved in one move (as long as they are stacked as in Solitaire

Features unique to this game:

   - The four individual cells start with cards in them
   - You may only go through the deck twice on draw one and three times on draw three
   - The obvious: there are only four columns, not 7 or 8 as in Solitaire and FreeCell, respectively
